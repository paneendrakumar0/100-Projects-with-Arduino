# Day 68: Stepper Motor Microstepping (A4988 Driver — All Step Resolutions)

Welcome to Day 68! Today we master **stepper motor microstepping** — the technique that makes 3D printers, CNC routers, and camera sliders move smoothly and silently. We configure all five microstepping modes on the **A4988 driver** (Full / Half / ¼ / ⅛ / 1/16 step) by toggling the MS1/MS2/MS3 pins, and implement a **trapezoidal velocity profile** to accelerate and decelerate without skipping steps.

## 🎯 The "Why" and "What"

A NEMA 17 stepper motor has 200 full steps per revolution (1.8° per step). In **full-step mode**, the rotor physically jumps between positions — causing vibration, resonance at certain speeds, and loud operation.

**Microstepping** solves this by energizing both motor coils simultaneously with varying current levels (approximating a sine wave), creating intermediate virtual steps between the physical poles:

| Mode | Steps/Rev | Angular Resolution | Smoothness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Step** | 200 | 1.800° | Vibrates, loud |
| **Half Step** | 400 | 0.900° | Smoother |
| **1/4 Step** | 800 | 0.450° | Good |
| **1/8 Step** | 1600 | 0.225° | Very smooth |
| **1/16 Step** | 3200 | 0.113° | Silky — used in 3D printers |

## 🔬 Physics & Mathematics

### 1. Stepper Motor Coil Physics
A two-phase stepper has two coil pairs (A and B). In full-step mode, one coil is fully on and the other is off:
$$\text{Phase A} = \pm I_{max}, \quad \text{Phase B} = 0 \text{ or } \pm I_{max}$$

In microstepping, both coils are energized simultaneously with sinusoidal amplitudes. For $N$ microsteps between full steps:
$$I_A(n) = I_{max} \cdot \cos\!\left(\frac{n \pi}{2N}\right), \quad I_B(n) = I_{max} \cdot \sin\!\left(\frac{n \pi}{2N}\right)$$

The rotor aligns to the combined magnetic field vector, stopping at $N$ intermediate positions between physical poles.

### 2. A4988 MS Pin Truth Table

| MS1 | MS2 | MS3 | Mode | Steps/Rev (1.8°) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LOW | LOW | LOW | Full | 200 |
| HIGH | LOW | LOW | Half | 400 |
| LOW | HIGH | LOW | 1/4 | 800 |
| HIGH | HIGH | LOW | 1/8 | 1600 |
| HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | 1/16 | 3200 |

### 3. Trapezoidal Velocity Profile
Accelerating instantly to full speed risks losing steps under load inertia. The trapezoidal profile ramps speed linearly:

```
Speed (steps/s)
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │      ┌──────────CRUISE──────────┐    │
  │  ACC/                            \DEC │
  │ /                                  \  │
  └──────────────────────────────────────┘
       Time →
```

The step period (µs between steps) is linearly interpolated:
$$\text{period}(i) = \text{START\_DELAY} - \frac{i}{\text{ACCEL\_STEPS}} \times (\text{START\_DELAY} - \text{MIN\_DELAY})$$

### 4. Current Sensing (A4988 VREF)
The A4988 limits coil current via a sense resistor. The current limit is set by trimming the VREF potentiometer on the driver board:
$$I_{max} = \frac{V_{REF}}{8 \times R_{sense}}$$

For typical A4988 boards with $R_{sense} = 0.1\,\Omega$:
$$I_{max} = \frac{V_{REF}}{0.8}$$

Set $V_{REF} = 0.4\,\text{V}$ for $I_{max} = 0.5\,\text{A}$ (good for NEMA 17 at lower torque). Measure VREF between the trimmer and GND.

## 🔩 Components Needed

| Component | Quantity | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arduino Uno | 1 | Controller |
| A4988 Stepper Driver | 1 | Current-controlled microstepping |
| NEMA 17 Stepper Motor | 1 | 1.8°, 200 steps/rev |
| 12V DC Power Supply (≥ 1A) | 1 | Motor voltage (VMOT) |
| 100 µF Electrolytic Capacitor | 1 | VMOT decoupling (prevents voltage spikes) |
| 10 kΩ Potentiometer | 1 | Speed control |
| Push Button | 1 | Mode cycling |

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Connect the 100 µF capacitor between VMOT and GND BEFORE powering on.** Without it, back-EMF from the motor can spike and destroy the A4988 permanently.

### Alternatives to A4988

## 💻 How to Test & Validate

1. Set VREF on the A4988 to match your motor's rated current (measure with multimeter).
2. Upload [Day_68_Stepper_Microstepping.ino](file:///d:/Downloads/100%20days%20of%20Arduino/Day_68_Stepper_Microstepping/Day_68_Stepper_Microstepping.ino).
3. Open **Serial Monitor** at **9600 Baud**.
4. The motor runs one revolution CW, then one CCW, repeating. Rotate the pot to change speed.
5. Press **D2 button** to cycle through step modes. Observe in serial: `[Mode] 1/16 Step (3200/rev)`.
6. **Listen:** Full step is loud and jittery; 1/16 step is nearly silent and buttery smooth.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Motor doesn't move | ENABLE pin not driven LOW | Check `digitalWrite(ENABLE_PIN, LOW)` before stepping |
| Motor vibrates but doesn't rotate | Wrong coil wiring (1A/1B/2A/2B) | Swap either 1A↔1B or 2A↔2B |
| Motor skips steps at high speed | MIN_DELAY_US too small or VREF too low | Increase `MIN_DELAY_US` or raise VREF |
| A4988 gets very hot | VREF too high | Lower VREF to match motor rated current |
| Smoke / burnt smell | No 100µF cap on VMOT | Power off immediately, add capacitor |
